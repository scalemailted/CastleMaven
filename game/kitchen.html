                A large pot bubbles and pops with some stew made an unknowably long time ago.  
                The odor put forth by it dissuades you from trying it, as the ingredients most likely went off long ago.

                Rotten vegetables and other sundries are spread around this room, indicating it was often used in the past.
                Due to this there may be a lot of areas to explore here.
