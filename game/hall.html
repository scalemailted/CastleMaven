                The air is musty and stale, as if it hasnâ€™t been disturbed for many years.  A thick layer of dust has built up over the years, coating all surfaces.
                
                Odd, since the hostel you were in last week mentioned someone going to scout this area a few months ago and you found detritus from a previous campsite outside the castle.
