                This writing room has a singly lit candle on the desk; however, the rest of the room seems undisturbed for many years.  The smell of parchment and wax permeate the air, but there is also unnerving, metallic tang to it.
            </h2>

                As you are wondering who could have left it, you search the desk for any secrets or hidden items.
                Apart from many faded, musty parchment rolls, you find no secret containers and only a single note written in a deep crimson ink.
