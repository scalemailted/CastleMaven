            <h2>
                As you enter, your eyes survey the room and find an old, empty, ornate bed and a warm, inviting fire with two comfy arm chairs in front.
            </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="main-body sandy-border">
            <p>
                Possed by some otherworldly influence, you move to the warmth of the fire; however, you carelessly knock over a table of ruined curios.
                As chills run down your spine, you hear the swoosh of fabric and a voice booms out from the once empty bed frame.
            </p>
            
            <p class="master">
                Who dares disturb my slumber! I shall deal with you like a cold winter night! 
            </p>
            <p>
                You turn to run but find yourself frozen solid.  To your horror, a disembodied skeletal arm grabs you by the collar and tosses you across the room, shattering you to pieces.
