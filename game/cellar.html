                Against your better judgement, you enter the forboding staircase.  The air smells of death and decay that crescendos as the cellar nears.

                As you descend the cold, clammy steps to the cellar, you slip and take a nasty tumble down them. Unfortunately, the blunt force trauma from the fall renders you unconscious and bleeding out. Hopefully the next adventurer will listen to their gut and avoid this tragic fate.
